# Working with Templates

In order to make things easier, and rather not have to type HTML over and over and over again, we can use templates.

## High level steps

1. Create a templates folder **in the app folder**. It must contain a subfolder with the same name as the app.
2. In the <appname>/templates/<appname> folder, create a file that will contain the template code.
    - The file name should be <nameOfYourMethodView>.html
3. Adapt/create the view.
    - In order to return the template (in a rendered form) I needed to change the the index method in my Servers\views.py


## Detailed steps

### Creating folders and files

First things first, I need to create a **template** folder with my template file(s) 

I added the following code in templates/index.html

```html
<h2> Template form</h2>
<p>
    This is my super template
</p>
```

> The '*templates*' folder must be located in your app folder, and it must contain a child folder with the same name as your app. In that child folder, we will add individual html files (one per method in our view folder)

```Powershell

/servers/templates/servers/index.html

```

## Adapting the view

>In Servers/views.py

Load the '**loader**' module first

```python
from django.template import loader
```

Adapt the correct view (**always** give it the **request** as parameter.)

in the method, load the template into a variable.

```python

template = loader.get_template('servers/index.html')

```

>by default, django is setup to look for the template file in a folder called templates **at the root** of our **app**.

to return information to the template file, use a dictionnary.
By convention, the **dictionnary name** is *always* called **context** (but it could be named what ever I want)

```python
    context = {
        'all_servers': all_servers,
    }
```

> always keep the dictionary keys and your variables the same. It will make things easier.

I then simply **render** the html page based on the dictionnary and the template, and send the calculated resutls back.

```python

return HttpResponse(template.render(context,request))

```

The complete function in the *server/views.py* looks  like this:

```python

def index(request):
    all_servers = Server.objects.all()
    template = loader.get_template('servers/index.html')

    context = {
        'all_servers': all_servers,
    }  
    return HttpResponse(template.render(context,request))

```

## How do I add the values (variables/data) into my template?

We now have the possibilty to add *python* code directy into our html template page.

The Python code simply needs to be located between the following signs

```python
{% %}
```

> The **'{% %}'** signs will allow us to integrate loops, if statements etc.. into our html template page based on the data we receive from the views.py method.
> Actually, each time I want to add python code in the html file, I need to use **{% %}**
> This sign must be used to start and end for loops / if statements.

```python

    {% for server in all_servers %}
        <li>this would be a server entry</li>
    {% endfor %}

```

to add references to variables directly, we need to use the following syntax:

```python
{{dictionnary.key}}
```

or, to get the computername from our server, we will use it like this:

```python
{{server.computername}}
```

I have put all of this together in the *servers/templates/servers/index.html* file:

```python

<h2> Server List</h2>

<p>
{%if all_servers%}
    ### {all_servers.count()} Servers:
    This is my super template
    <ul>
        {% for server in all_servers %}
        <li><a href="{{server.id}}">{{server.computername}}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
{% else %}
    <h3>No servers to display</h3>
{% endif %}
</p>

```

The code above will create a an unordered list which will contain a link pointing to the server.id page of our server. It will be displayed using the computername of the server.

> Remeber, the data is passed to the template using a **dictionnary** in the **servers/views.py**. The dictionnary must be returned with the request.

>The convention is that the dictionnary is set in a variable called **context** and that is the variable that is sent back together with **request**.


## Final results

The generated file will look like this in the end:

Beautiful!

## Shortcut

It is possible to condense the code more, and putt the rendering, the template and the httpreponse in one and single line.

> we **don't have** to use this method, but it is just shorter code.

1. we need to import the shortcut module

```python

from django.shortcuts import render

```

then, instead of creating the template variable, and rendering it, we can actually render, and pass the path to the template as a parameter.

```python

render(request, 'servers/index.html',context)

```
