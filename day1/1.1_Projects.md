# Creating a project

# Create my first django project

Open a powershell prompt as admin, and navigate to the place where you want to store your website.
I have put mine here

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Stephane\OneDrive\Blogs\PowerShellDistrict\Python\django\
```

I needed to find a good name for my website, withtout any good idea, i went for the 'MyFirstWebSite' Awesome name.
Then, I simply needed to use the following syntax:

```powershell
django-admin.exe startproject <YourProjectName>
```

Which for me turned out to result in:

```powershell
django-admin.exe startproject MyFirstWebSite
```

## creation process
 This actually creates a bunch of starter files in the path you are currently at.

I have writen a few lines to explain each usage of each folder/file

    ><MyFirstWebsite>
    >   <MyFirstWebsite>
    >    __init__.py --> tell python to view this directory as a python package.
        >    settings.py -> Contains all the settings related to the website
        >    urls.py --> url declaration of the website (table of content). maps a view to an url.
        >    wsgi.py --> webserverGateway interface (talk more about it later)
    >manage.py -> Is there to help to manage the Website. Create DB Structure, Users etc..



#Starting the server

In order to start/run the server we have to manage it again from the same powershell prompt (run as admin).

Navigate to the location where you created the website

```powershell
cd C:\Users\stephane\OneDrive\Blogs\PowerShellDistrict\Python\django\MyFirstWebSite
```

and then I typed the following command:

```powershell
python manage.py runserver 
```

>Server is now available at -> http://127.0.0.1:8000/
