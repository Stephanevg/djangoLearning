# URL matching

Whenever a user requests something from our website.
It will go into the 'MyFirstWebSite' folder, and search for MyFirstWebSite\MyFirstWebSite\urls.py first.

in the urls.py file we indicate using regex expressions, where the request should be redirected to.
We could directly write in the urls.py, but is *not* a good idea.

Instead, create a *urls.py per app* and have it a the root folder of each app.

in the main urls.py (MyFirstWebSite\MyFirstWebSite\urls.py) we have normally the following content:

```python
from django.conf.urls import url
    from django.contrib import admin


    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]
```

we can actually create urls.py file in each app, and make the website point the urls.py from each app.

To do so, I needed to rerout the incoming requests for my servers app using the following url pattern:

```python

url(r'^servers/', include('servers.urls'))

```

>important: Do not forget to important url and include from django.conf.urls

The urls.py will then look as this:

```python
from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^servers/', include('servers.urls')),
    
]
```

The include above, is simply going to the folder server\urls.py and read the content of that file.
The file *must* contain urls that are 'local' to the app.

The urls.py file located in the app, works identically as the urlpatterns in the root directory of your site (via Regex using the urlpatterns = [] table)
