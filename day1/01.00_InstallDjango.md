# Install django

The installation of django is actually not that complicated, it is necessary to have python installed and added to your $env:path variable (of course..)
simply type the following in an *elevated* command prompt

```python
pip install django
```

> It is possible (and actually recommended) to use a virtualenv 

## verification

To see if django is installed, and to see which version is currently installed, I used the following command:

```Python
django-admin.exe --version
```

which returned '1.11.6' in my case.
