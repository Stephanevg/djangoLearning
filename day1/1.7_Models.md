# working with Models 2/2

[Tutorial 8 - Activating models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dONYOtb2ySI&index=8&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK)

First things first, each time we create a new app on our server, we need to add it to the **INSTALLED_APPS** section.

(Remeber, on line 33 of the **settings.py** file)

We need to declare our app in that array. To do so, we need to point a reference to the Config.

>Where do I find this 'Config'?

Easy, you can find it respecting the following logic:
> <AppName>\apps.py-><AppName>Config

In our case:
>Servers\apps.py see the method called **ServersConfig**

```Python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'servers.apps.ServersConfig'
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]
```

## Making migrations

The next (and last) step, consists in doing the migration, as explained in the first part.

To do so, we have to do this in 2 steps:
1. Create the migration files 
2. Execute the migration files.

### How to creae the migration files?

> Easy, use the following command (in a powershell prompt)

```powershell
python manage.py makemigrations <appName>
```

For example:

```powershell
python manage.py makemigrations servers
```

Output

```powershell
Migrations for 'servers':
  servers\migrations\0001_initial.py
    - Create model Script
    - Create model Server
    - Add field server to script
```

Once that the migration files have been created, we can go ahead and create 'really' migrate

```powershell
python .\manage.py migrate
```

Output

```powershell
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: servers
Running migrations:
  Applying servers.0001_initial... OK
```
