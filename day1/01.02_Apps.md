Creating Apps:
[Tutorial - Creating Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4saN7GZnawU&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK&index=3)

in Django, Each section of a website is an app

blog -> is an app
forum --> is an app
video --> is an app

>To memerorize -> I have to try and explain in once sentence If not possible, break it further

I used the following syntax to create my first app:

```powershell

python manage.py startapp <appName>

```

I decided that the first app in my project would be 'Servers'

```powershell
python manage.py startapp Servers 
```

## Folder strucutre

This will create a new subfolder in the website called "Servers" containing a bunch of files and folders.
For convenience, I have listem them here:

```python
    __init__.py --> tells this is django package
    admin.py --> contains the admin section of the webite (Add remove users etc..)
    apps.py --> Configuration file
    models.py --> Classes --> blue print for your DB
                What tables for Servers
                    Class Server:
                        HostName
                        DomainName
                        Location
                        Owner
    tests.py --> for unit tests
    views.py --> contains just functions. It takes a user request, and gives a page back.

```

One file is missing here though, and it is the urls.py file which is used to manage the routing in our app.
I create this file a bit later.
