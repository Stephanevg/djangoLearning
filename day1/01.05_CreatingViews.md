# creating views

It works like this:
    This file, takes the user request, and returns a function.

each app has a *views.py* file.

an example would be the following one:

```python
    def index(request):
        return httpREsponse("<h1>Returning first page</h1>")
```

We we try to connect to our website/app -> http://127.0.0.1:8000/servers/

Django will search for the index function (which is the default function that is called if no additional parameters are added at the end of the url).
And execute the code that is located in there. Remeber, in the end, the function should always return html.
In this case, it simply returns a H1 tag.
