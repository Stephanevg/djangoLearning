# URL rooting

[video tutorial - Create urls file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAn1KpPlN2w&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK&index=5)

The following code allowed me to create a new urls.py file containing the default needed imports and regex.

```powershell

$f = New-Item -ItemType file -Path .\ -Name urls.py
$urls = @"
    from django.conf.urls import url
    from . import views

    urlpattern = [
        url(r'^$',views.index,name='index'),
    ]
"@

$urls | Out-File $f

```

## urls.py redirections

Now that we have our urls.py in our app, we need to tell django to search in that <app>\urls.py (servers\urls.py) when a request comes in for <app>
 

I simply edited the (main) urls.py and added the following url pattern

```python
    url(r'^servers/', include(servers.urls)),
```

> Note to my self: as a general note when using include(s) don't forget to import include on top of the file first...
