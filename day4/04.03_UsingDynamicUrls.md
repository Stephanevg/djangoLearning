#Naming your urls

[Video 20 - Removing Hardcoded URLS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQll-WgZcpE&index=20&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBlmzzFcLgDhKTTfNLfX1IK)

If we have a look again at what exactly an url, is, we had it composed of three elements:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

1. URL
2. Method pointer
3. --> that is the big question that I will answer now.

The ```name=index``` is actually the name of the combination of the __regex__ and the __methodPointer__. 
In other words, it is possible to refer to that exact part of our urlspattern using a name.

## How to use the name?

>Ok cool, but how do I use it in my code?

In order to use in code, we can call it using the following syntax:

```python

{% url '<NameOfTheUrl>' <UrlParameter> %}

```

```python

{% url 'detail' server_id %}

```

This works well for one app. When more and more apps come into your webpage, it can happen that the models (the functions) have the same name.

You will see that in the next step of this tutorial, we make this even cooler using Namespaces.
