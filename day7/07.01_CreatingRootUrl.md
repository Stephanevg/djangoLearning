# Creating the root url

This might seem obvious, but when you go to the root of your website, you want to go to specefic location of your website. this wasn't implemented in my site until now. Let's fix this :)


Since my views are **classed based** now, this added an extra layer of complexity.

We want to target the following url:

```r'^$``` and want to reroute the trafic to the following page: **servers/list.html**. This is controlled through the view ```IndexView```of our **servers/views.py** file.

Also, the name of the url should be **index**.

## How to proceed?

Simple, first we need to **import** the **views** from the servers app, we use the following line of code for that: ```from servers import views```

Now that we have imported that, we can create our regex:

1. regex = ```^$```
2. name of the url = ```name='index'```
3. function call = ```views.IndexView.As_view()```

The full **url** looks like this:

>```url(r'^$',views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),```

I added this to the **myFirstWebSite/urls.py**. See here under the result.

```python

from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin
from servers import views

app_name = 'root'

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$',views.IndexView.as_view(), name='index'),
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
    url(r'^servers/', include('servers.urls')),
    url(r'^scripts/', include('scripts.urls')),
]

```
