# How to get information from the DB (connecting to the DB)

We can use the *same* syntax as in the chapter 1.8 DBAApi.

For this we need to adapt some of our views.

If we head over to the servers/views.py we have the following:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>Returning first page</h1>")

def detail(request,server_id):
    return HttpResponse("<h2>Details for server id: {0}</h2>".format(server_id))

```

To query the DB, in the functions, we have access to our DB juste like in the python interpreter (see chapter 1.8).

To get *all* the servers from the db, I simply use the following command:

```python
servers.objects.all()
```


> don't forget to import the Server model

> When importing the Server model from the python shell ( **python .\manage.py shell**) I needed to spycify the complete path to the models folder.
>In my case, i had to write this:
>
>```python
>from servers.models import Server
>```

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
from .models import Server
# Create your views here.

def index(request):
    all_servers = Server.objects.all()

    html = ""
    for server in all_servers:
        url = "/servers/" + str(server.id) + "/"
        html += '<a href="' + url + '">' + server.computername + '</a><br>'
    return HttpResponse(html)

def detail(request,server_id):
    return HttpResponse("<h2>Details for server id: {0}</h2>".format(server_id))

```

It returns something like this:

## Explanation

above, I am creating the url first in the *url* variable, which actually contains a link ( *'&lt; a href &gt;'*) to the url to get the detail of server.
Remember, in order to get the details of a server, we have set it up in the previous chapter.

The following *urlpattern* (located in servers/urls.py)

```python
url(r'^(?P<server_id>[0-9]+)/$',views.detail,name='detail'),
```

redirects any requests that comes in to 'servers/123' (where 123 is a random digit)
And will redirect it to the function 'detail' located in the views.py file.

The function detail from the views.py file is the following one

```python
def detail(request,server_id):
    return HttpResponse("<h2>Details for server id: {0}</h2>".format(server_id))
```
simply returns a htmlResponse that is nothing less then a HTML h2 tag with the ID of the server.

In the index function, the view with the links to the ID of the servers is generated.
As soon as it is clicked, it redirects me to the correct servers/123 url, which points to the details function, which returns that http response.



>This a simple way to send html back. But this is *not* the good way to do so. See next chapter.
