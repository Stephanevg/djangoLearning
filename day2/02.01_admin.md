# Working with admin

Django comes with a predefined admin panel, which makes the management really easy.

3 steps need to be followed:

1. create the superUser
2. Set the password
3. log in ;)


```Powershell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

```Python
Username (leave blank to use 'taavast3'): admin
Email address: admin@admin.com
Password:
Password (again):
This password is too common.
Password:
Password (again):
This password is too short. It must contain at least 8 characters.
This password is too common.
This password is entirely numeric.
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
```

Password Pass1234

We can log in the admin area, but there is no trace of any of our classes / tables.

To make them visible, we have to 'register' them.

## Register a new site

In order to be in the admin panel, the site needs to be registered first.

```Python
from .models import Server

admin.site.register(Server)
```

> notice the '.' (the point) in the import statement. It is important to let python know that we want to import from the current directory.

If we go and log back to the admin panel:

The register needs to be done in each admin.py for each app.

The scripts app **admin.py** looks like this:

```python

from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Script

admin.site.register(Script)

```
