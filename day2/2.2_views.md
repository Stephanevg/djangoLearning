# Managing views

A view, can be summarized as followed:

> A view, is a function, that returns HTML code.

in *servers/urls.py* the urlpatterns = [] need to be adapted.

Each url pattern should point to a specefic function

```Python
urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
]
```

If we have closer look at the url, we have the following main parts:
1. regex filter

```Python
r'^$'

```

2. function (point to a specefic function, in a specefic file.)

```Python
views.index

```

3. Parameter

```Python
name='index'

```

We want to aim to have the following url:
>/servers/54

(54 would be an id)

```Python
r'^(?p<server_id>[0-9]+)/$'
```
the id part (54) will be save in a variable called 'server_id' which will be available in the function called

```Python
url(r'^(?P<server_id>[0-9]+)/$',views.detail,name='detail')```

in *views.url* we mus create a function called 'detail'.


```python

def detail(request,server_id):
    return HttpResponse("<h2>Details for server id: {0}</h2>".format(server_id))

```

We set (as always) the *request* as parameter, but this time I added the *"server_id"*

It allows us to pass a parameter through the url, directly to one of our functions.  In this case, we pass a digit, and it will be displayed in an h2 tag.
